Start Options
=============

I am an addict in a skooma den. -> An Addict
-------------------------------

I can't believe I've finally found the den! The shaking has gotten worse ever since I left home, but now my suffering is at an end. I do have a strange feeling about this den, though...

You spawn in Redwater Den with only some basic provisions.


I am an adventurer in a Dwemer ruin. -> Inside a Dwemer Ruin
------------------------------------

I knew I shouldn't have touched that orb, but my curiosity got the better of me. I pray to the Gods that there's a way out of here...

You spawn in Kagrenzel with a set of leather armor and some basic equipment.


I am an alchemist camping in the wilderness. -> I'm an Alchemist in the Wild
--------------------------------------------

It's been a while since I left home to become an alchemist, and I can't help but long for something more exciting to do than picking flowers. Maybe it's time I left this grove behind...

You spawn at a camp near Evergreen Grove with some provisions and alchemy ingredients.


I have arrived at Angi's camp in Falkreath Hold. -> At Angi's Camp
------------------------------------------------

I have come across the camp of a markswoman named Angi. Maybe I should ask her to train me.

You spawn at Angi's camp with a set of leather armor and some basic equipment. Thanks to leomorg for the suggestion!


I am a beggar. -> I'm a Beggar
--------------

I don't even remember how long I've been living here in this gods-forsaken place. It's time I got out of here and became an adventurer or joined the Thieves' Guild or the Forsworn or something along those lines. Gods know anything would be better than continuing to rot away in this dump.

You can spawn either in Beggar's Row in Riften or the Markarth Warrens with only tattered rags for clothing and a few gold coins.


I was attacked by a dragon. -> Attacked by a Dragon
---------------------------

By the Gods! I knew we should have sent for the guards sooner. When the dragon came, I ran inside immediately, but it looks like the others didn't make it. I have no I idea what to do now, but since everything here is destroyed, I have no choice but to leave and start over...

You spawn in a hut near Ancient's Ascent with some food and a woodcutter's axe as your only means of self-defense.


I have been thrown into jail. -> Thrown into Jail
-----------------------------

Well, here I am... I can't believe those imbecile guards actually caught me. If I don't want to serve my time in here, I better start looking for a way out.

You spawn in a jail of your choosing, where you can either serve your time or try and break out. If you do the latter, be sure to recover your belongings from the evidence chest!


I am a pilgrim to a temple. -> Pilgriming to a Temple
---------------------------

I have finally arrived at the temple. Now that I have received the blessings of the Divines, I should start looking for work in town. I can't go back home after all...

You spawn in a temple in a town with a monk outfit and some provisions.


I am a pilgrim to a to a sacred site. -> Pilgriming to a Sacred Site
-------------------------------------

Depending on your choice, you spawn at the Shrine of Azura, the Sacellum of Boethiah, the Shrine of Mehrunes Dagon, the Eldergleam Sanctuary, the Statue to Meridia, the Shrine of Peryite, Stendarr's Beacon, or the Hall of the Vigilant with appropriate equipment and enough provisions to continue your travels.


I was imprisoned by the Thalmor. -> Thalmor Prisoner
--------------------------------

I've actually been imprisoned by those gods-damn Thalmor! If I don't want to be tortured until I renounce my faith in Talos, now is the time to get out of here. Those guards don't seem particularly attentive...

You spawn in Northwatch Keep with nothing but a few lockpicks for equipment. Good luck!


I was slain by a vampire and laid to rest. -> Slaim by a Vampire
------------------------------------------

A few days ago I was struck down by an intense fever. Luckily, none of the fools that are my family seem to have recognized my symptoms for what they were, so they entombed me here after my death. Now I'm finally free to leave them behind and start a new life.

You spawn in a hall of the dead or graveyard of your choice with your grave goods for equipment.


I am a wandering merchant / mercenary. -> A Merchant/Mercenary wandering to Skyrim
--------------------------------------

There's an old Cyrodiilic proverb: "The riskier the road, the greater the profit." This civil war in Skyrim is bound to be good for business. I'd be a fool if I didn't take this opportunity. After all, I can hardly make less money than back home...

You spawn at one of Skyrim's border outposts. If you choose to be a merchant, you start with a horse and an inventory full of random wares; if you choose the mercenary option, you start with a full set of steel plate armor and some provisions. Thanks to ZeroSaber39 for suggesting the border outposts as a starting location!


I am a werewolf at Frostmoon Crag. -> Werewolf at Frostmoon Crag
----------------------------------

I've now been staying with Majni's pack for quite a while, but the others still regard me as a stranger. I've got enough gold to pay for passage to Skyrim, so maybe I should leave and start traveling again...

You spawn at Frostmoon Crag (obviously) with a few provisions and enough gold to travel to Skyrim.


I am a warlock/witch in a secluded lair. -> At home in a Seduced Lair
----------------------------------------

It has been how long since I was accepted into this coven? Months? Years? And what have I been doing all that time? I can count the number of times I've left this cave on one hand. It is time I leave and explore the outside world.

You start with a mage outfit, some magic scrolls, and some provisions. Male characters spawn in Cragwallow Slope, female ones in Snapleg Cave. The NPCs in your starting location will remain friendly as long as you don't attack them.
